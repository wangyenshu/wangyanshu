::: {#hero-heading}

I am interested in algebra and number theory. I have done the Polymath Jr. REU with the topic of Dessin d'enfant (arithmetic approach). I have finished relevant courses including Abstract Algebra, Galois Theory, Number Theory, and Commutative Algebra. Currently, I am self-learning scheme theory to prepare to learn arithmetic geometry and at the same time, taking the Analytic Number Theory course. I have experience of writing papers and am fluent with latex. My programming skills also includes C++, python, lean4, html & css & javascript.
