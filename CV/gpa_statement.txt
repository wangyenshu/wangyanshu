My exchange semester at Temple University is tuition-free. I selected two Graduate Courses in that semester (Topics in Algebra and Functions of Complex Variable I). I get low grades in French because I put a lot of effort into the Senior Year Individual Study, which is an undergraduate research project about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group mentored by Professor Vasily Dolgushev.

Explanation for low grades in Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, and Real Analysis: I took too many courses in the second semester of the sophomore year, including Real Analysis, Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, Commutative Algebra, Lie Groups, and Algebraic Groups.

Explanation for low grades in PDE, stochastic process: I continued to do the Polymath Jr. online REU in that semester, and these two courses' grading is generally bad.
