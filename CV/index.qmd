## OBJECTIVE 
I am interested in algebra and number theory. I have done the Polymath Jr. REU with the topic of Dessin d'enfant (arithmetic approach). I have finished relevant courses including Abstract Algebra, Galois Theory, Number Theory, and Commutative Algebra. I have experience of writing papers and am fluent with latex. My programming skills also includes C++, python, lean4, html & css & javascript.

## Published Papers

## Research Experience

- **Mitacs Globalink Research Internship**, Université de Sherbrooke<span class="cvdate">May 2025 – Current</span>  
  - TBD

- **Independent Study with Professor Vasily Dolgushev**, Temple University<span class="cvdate">Jan 2025 – Current</span>  
  - TBD
  
- **Polymath Jr.**, Online<span class="cvdate">2024 – 2025</span>  
  - Our group gives algebraic and complex analytic approaches to computing an affine model for $K_9$ dessin, and I draw a visualization of $K_9$ dessin through the morphism $\pi_1(P_8/\sim) \to \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_8]/(1+\sqrt{-2})$.
  - I Work out the algebraic approach and visualization, delivered the final presentation, drafted the algebraic section of the ongoing paper/report, and created the poster submitted to JMM 2025 with the help of mentors.

- **BICMR AI4MATH**, BICMR(Peking University)<span class="cvdate">Jan 2024 – Feb 2024</span>  
  - I collaborate with four students to formalize the statement that 'Algebraic integer of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{-3}]$ is PID' in lean4.
  - This project introduced me to functional programming, dependent type theory and proof‑assistant design, and sharpened my collaboration and rapid‑learning abilities.

**UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR:**<br>

- Geometric Group Theroy Seminar: This seminar uses UTX book Geometric Group Theory An Introduction. I participated in it in the first semester of the sophomore year.<br>

- Algebraic Number Theory Seminar: This seminar mainly uses lecture notes by Hu Yong. I learned many algebraic number theory from the video <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fu41127KW/>.<br>

- Quasi-Conformal Mapping and Potential Theory: I use the notes from <https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/b.khoruzhenko/potential_th_notes.pdf>. <br>

- Analytic Number Theory Online Seminar: Led by a senior alumna (M.S., University of Bonn). The main topic is o‑minimality and tame geometry.<br>

**MINI COURSE:**<br>

- Propagation speed of non-linear parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds by Prof. Alexander Grigor's yan

- Preliminary Arizona Winter School 2024:Symmetries of root systems and local fields (unofficially following the course)

<!--
**REMARK:** <br> 

Add it to personal statement!

- Nankai University's undergraduate degree requires me to take approximately 6 courses in applied mathematics or 6 courses in computational mathematics. That is why there are many applied mathematics courses in my transcript. Another effect is that I have to audit some courses due to conflict time schedules and excessive workloads. <br>

- Explanation for low grades in Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, Real Analysis: I take too many courses in the second semester of the sophomore year, including Real Analysis, Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, Commutative Algebra, Lie Groups and Algebraic Groups. Explanation for low grades in PDE, stochastic process: I continued to do the Polymath Jr. research in that semester and these two courses' grading is generally bad.<br>
