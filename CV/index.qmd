## OBJECTIVE 

I am interested in algebra and number theory. I have done the Polymath Jr. REU with the topic of Dessin d'enfant (arithmetic approach). I have finished relevant courses including Abstract Algebra, Galois Theory, Number Theory, and Commutative Algebra. Currently, I am self-learning scheme theory to prepare to learn arithmetic geometry and at the same time, taking the Analytic Number Theory course. I have experience of writing papers and am fluent with latex. My programming skills also includes C++, python, lean4, html & css & javascript.

**UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR:**<br>

- Geometric Group Theroy Seminar: This seminar uses UTX book Geometric Group Theory An Introduction. I participate in it in the first semester of the sophomore year.<br>

- Algebraic Number Theory Seminar: This seminar mainly uses lecture notes by Hu Yong. I learned many algebraic number theory from the video <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fu41127KW/>.<br>

- Quasi-Conformal Mapping and Potential Theory: I use the notes from <https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/b.khoruzhenko/potential_th_notes.pdf>. <br>

- Analytic Number Theory Online Seminar: This seminar is conducted by a senior alumna (pursuing master degree at University of Bonn). The main topic is o-minimality and some Tame Geometry.<br>

**MINI COURSE:**<br>

- Propagation speed of non-linear parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds by Prof. Alexander Grigor's yan

- Preliminary Arizona Winter School 2024:Symmetries of root systems and local fields (unofficially following the course)

<!--
**REMARK:** <br> 

- Nankai University's undergraduate degree requires me to take approximately 6 courses in applied mathematics or 6 courses in computational mathematics. That is why there are many applied mathematics courses in my transcript. Another effect is that I have to audit some courses due to conflict time schedules and excessive workloads. <br>

- Explanation for low grades in Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, Real Analysis:I take too much courses in the second semester of the sophomore year, including Real Analysis, Probability Theory, Pointwise Topology, Commutative Algebra, Lie Groups and Algebraic Groups. <br>

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Polymath Jr.

This is a group project. Our group gives algebraic and complex analytic approaches to computing an affine model for $K_9$ dessin, and I draw a visualization of $K_9$ dessin through the morphism $\pi_1(P_8/\sim) \mapsto \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_8]/(1+\sqrt{-2})$. For my contribution, I work out the algebraic approaches and draw the visualization. I also gave the final presentation of the group work, wrote the algebraic approaches part of the paper (the paper is still in progress), and made the poster that was submitted to JMM 2025. If there is no visa issue, I will go to JMM 2025 and give a talk about that.

#### Independent Study with Professor Vasily Dolgushev

#### Mitacs Research Internship

#### BICMR AI4MATH

I collaborate with four students to formalize in lean4 that Algebraic integer of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{-3}]$ is PID. I learn a a lot of knowledge about functional programming and constructing a proof assistant. I lean some basic dependent type theory. Above all, I gain more ability of collaboration and of learning new things quickly.
