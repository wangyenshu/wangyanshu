    "text": "STATEMENT OF PURPOSE\n\n\nYANSHU WANG\n\nMy primary research interest lies in the area of number theory, and arithmetic geometry. I am actively involved in a research project that introduces a more streamlined version of the groupoid \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\), which is an approximation of a specific type of Grothendieck–Teichmüller group. But I am open to exploring new ideas as well.\n\n\n© Copyright 2025, Yanshu Wang\n\nUnder the supervision of Professor Vasily Dolgushev, I conducted the research that introduced a more streamlined version of the groupoid \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) of \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows and contributed to the SageMath package for working with \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows. The groupoid \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) is a ‘computable’ approximation to the gentle version of the Grothendieck–Teichmüller group \\(\\widehat{\\mathsf{GT}}_{gen}\\). The set of objects of \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) is the poset \\(\\mathsf{NFI}^{\\mathrm{B}_3}(\\mathrm{F}_2)\\) of \\(\\mathrm{B}_3\\)-invariant finite index normal subgroups of the free group \\(\\mathrm{F}_2\\) on two generators. This object is worth studying because it is very ‘likely’ that in most cases, the element of \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) lifts to the absolute Galois group. And it is already known that for dihedral posets, every element of \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) lifts to the absolute Galois group.\nMentored by Professor Maxence Mayrand, I participated in a research internship that constructed new GKP code from the Abelian varieties on the cyclotomic field \\(K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)\\). The construction \\((K \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathbb{R})/\\mathcal{O}_K\\) is an abelian variety of CM-type. We defined a skew-symmetric form \\(E\\) and extended it to a hermitian inner product \\(H\\) on \\((K \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\mathbb{R})/\\mathcal{O}_K\\). Under certain restrictions, this defines a GKP code. There is a homomorphism from \\(\\mathrm{Aut}(X,L)\\) to \\(\\{\\text{unitary operators on }H^0(X,L\\otimes L)\\}\\), the gates. It is already known that this construction produces Clifford gates. I computed the decomposition of these Clifford gates as the Hadamard gate, S-gate and CNOT-gate. An interesting phenomenon is that the expression of the gate produced by the case \\(n=5\\) contains CNOT-gate.\nUnder the supervision of Professor Lisa Berger, Ajmain Yamin and Connor Stewart, I participated in an online collaborative research to obtain equations for \\(K_9\\) dessin, that is the bipartification dessin of the complete regular map from \\(K_9\\) graph. We proved that the Riemann surface of the \\(K_9\\) dessin is a degree \\(9\\) cover of the Bolza surface \\(y^2=x(x^4-1)\\) with covering group \\((\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2\\). We used the fact that any unramified abelian cover of a Riemann surface \\(S\\) is obtained from pulling back S along an unramified abelian cover of the Jacobian \\(\\mathrm{Jac}(S)\\) of \\(S\\). So, we computed the equation for the Abel-Jacobi map of the Bolza surface \\(S_B\\) and constructed a degree \\(9\\) cover of the Jacobian \\(\\mathrm{Jac}(S_B)\\) and obtained the equation.\nThese research experiences let me explore a wide range of mathematics and significantly improve my self-learning, writing, programming and speaking skills. It is these research experiences that boost my determination to seek admission to a graduate program and do mathematical research.\nMy short-term plan after admission is to try to pass the qualification exam in the first year, finish the required courses and teaching duties, attend colloquia, find an advisor, and begin my dissertation work as soon as possible. My long-term plan is to to become a Mathematics professor at a research institution and make original contributions to the mathematics community. I like Pennsylvania State University’s historic architecture and large areas of green spaces. I believe Pennsylvania State University is the best place for me to build a successful mathematical career."

    "section": "Why Study Mathematics?",
    "text": "Why Study Mathematics?\nMy interest in advanced mathematics started in middle school, when I accidentally encountered the well-known physics puzzle of solving the resistance value of two points in a two-dimensional infinite lattice of resistors. My physics teacher in middle school showed me that if the position of these two points is very symmetric, it can be solved using elementary mathematics. When I searched the Internet for solutions for general position cases, I first encountered the term ‘Fourier analysis’ and found that it required advanced mathematics.\nIn high school, I learned the differential element method from a physics course. And later, I self-learned the epsilon-delta language to give a rigorous explanation. The physics knowledge combined with calculus seems to be able to predict any changes in real life, and the rigorous mathematical proof endows that prediction with absolute reliability. At that time, I was really fascinated by the power and reliability of mathematics (actually, analysis).\nThen, I went to the mathematically best university that I was able to get into – Nankai University. I completed the course of honour mathematical analysis and honour linear algebra with good grades and enrolled in a variety of graduate-level mathematics courses. The abstract algebra course by Prof. Binbin Xu led me to make the decision to study algebra and number theory. His course is very clear, the theory of groups, rings, fields, and modules is well-organized, and theorems are beautiful. So I enrolled in Galois theory, commutative algebra, (algebraic) number theory, and linear algebraic groups to dive deeper into algebraic topics. I also self-learned some algebraic geometry from Prof. Richard Borcherds’ YouTube channel."

I learned about compact Riemann surfaces and dessins d’enfants and practiced my Mathematica programming skills. I contributed to the final presentation slides, made the poster, and gave a presentation at JMM 2025 AMS Special Session on Polymath Jr REU Student Research Session and presented the poster at JMM 2025 AMS-PME Undergraduate Poster Sessions. I also learned a lot from lectures at JMM2025 and made many friends with other student participants.\nI visited Temple University in January after JMM 2025 and did research on the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group with Prof. Vasily Dolgushev. Since I already knew Dessin d’enfant and enrolled in a graduate braid group course at Temple University, all background knowledge is already satisfied. We revisit the gentle version \\(\\widehat{\\mathsf{GT}}_{gen}\\) of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group and introduce a more streamlined version of the groupoid \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) of \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows. The paper is in progress. Moreover, I contribute to the SageMath package for working with \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows. I learned many precautions in academic writing, like how to write a proper introduction and how to organize sections in a flow. I also practiced my SageMath programming skills (especially libgap), and OOP method.\nI am admitted to the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship at Université de Sherbrooke under the mentorship of Prof. Maxence Mayrand. I constructed new GKP codes from the Abelian varieties on the cyclotomic field and computed the decomposition of the corresponding Clifford gate as H-gate, S-gate, and CNOT-gate. Meanwhile, I developed SageMath scripts for working with GKP codes constructed from the cyclotomic field. We use the book Complex Abelian Varieties by Herbert Lange. This research experience enhanced my programming skills and the ability to apply mathematics to solve concrete problems."

    "text": "Overcoming Obstacles\nBy determination and the help of professors and friends, I have overcome various obstacles encountered on my mathematical path. The most harmful (bureaucratic) obstacle was a policy that limited a particular portion of students’ options to either pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at their current institution or change their academic focus (from pure mathematics to applied mathematics). I overcame this obstacle by taking the required courses in both pure mathematics and applied mathematics and devoting double efforts to coursework. Another obstacle was that as an exchange undergraduate student at Temple University, I was not allowed to enroll in graduate mathematics courses. Thanks to Prof. David Futer, the Graduate Director, I was granted permission to enroll in graduate mathematics courses after reaching out."

We proved that the Riemann surface of the \\(K_9\\) dessin is a degree \\(9\\) cover of the Bolza surface \\(y^2=x(x^4-1)\\) with covering group \\((\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2\\). We used the fact that any unramified abelian cover of a Riemann surface \\(S\\) is obtained from pulling back S along an unramified abelian cover of the Jacobian \\(\\mathrm{Jac}(S)\\) of \\(S\\). So, we computed the equation for the Abel-Jacobi map of the Bolza surface \\(S_B\\) and constructed a degree \\(9\\) cover of the Jacobian \\(\\mathrm{Jac}(S_B)\\) and obtained the equation.\nThese research experiences let me explore a wide range of mathematics and significantly improve my self-learning, writing, programming and speaking skills. It is these research experiences that boost my determination to seek admission to a graduate program and do mathematical research.\nMy short-term plan after admission is to try to pass the qualification exam in the first year, finish the required courses and teaching duties, attend colloquia, find an advisor, and begin my dissertation work as soon as possible. My long-term plan is to to become a Mathematics professor at a research institution and make original contributions to the mathematics community. I hope to learn from and do research with Professor Rachel Pries. I am interested in Professor Rachel Pries’s paper “Cohomology groups of Fermat curves via ray class fields of cyclotomic fields”. Although I cannot understand it completely, I like working on profinite groups and group (co)homology. I like Colorado State University’s historic architecture, large areas of green spaces and pristine views of the Rocky Mountain foothills. I believe Colorado State University is the best place for me to build a successful mathematical career."

    "text": "Why Study Mathematics?\nMy interest in advanced mathematics started in middle school, when I accidentally encountered the well-known physics puzzle of solving the resistance value of two points in a two-dimensional infinite lattice of resistors. My physics teacher in middle school showed me that if the position of these two points is very symmetric, it can be solved using elementary mathematics. When I searched the Internet for solutions for general position cases, I first encountered the term ‘Fourier analysis’ and found that it required advanced mathematics.\nIn high school, I learned the differential element method from a physics course. And later, I self-learned the epsilon-delta language to give a rigorous explanation. The physics knowledge combined with calculus seems to be able to predict any changes in real life, and the rigorous mathematical proof endows that prediction with absolute reliability. At that time, I was really fascinated by the power and reliability of mathematics (actually, analysis).\nThen, I went to the mathematically best university that I was able to get into – Nankai University. I completed the course of honour mathematical analysis and honour linear algebra with good grades and enrolled in a variety of graduate-level mathematics courses. The abstract algebra course by Prof. Binbin Xu led me to make the decision to study algebra and number theory. His course is very clear, the theory of groups, rings, fields, and modules is well-organized, and theorems are beautiful. So I enrolled in Galois theory, commutative algebra, (algebraic) number theory, and linear algebraic groups to dive deeper into algebraic topics. I also self-learned some algebraic geometry from Prof. Richard Borcherds’ YouTube channel."

    "text": "Research Experience\nOn my sophomore summer vacation, I did the online Polymath Jr. REU to obtain equations for \\(K_9\\) Dessin. I learned about compact Riemann surfaces and dessins d’enfants and practiced my Mathematica programming skills. I contributed to the final presentation slides, made the poster, and gave a presentation at JMM 2025 AMS Special Session on Polymath Jr REU Student Research Session and presented the poster at JMM 2025 AMS-PME Undergraduate Poster Sessions. I also learned a lot from lectures at JMM2025 and made many friends with other student participants.\nI visited Temple University in January after JMM 2025 and did research on the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group with Prof. Vasily Dolgushev. Since I already knew Dessin d’enfant and enrolled in a graduate braid group course at Temple University, all background knowledge is already satisfied. We revisit the gentle version \\(\\widehat{\\mathsf{GT}}_{gen}\\) of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group and introduce a more streamlined version of the groupoid \\(\\mathsf{GTSh}\\) of \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows. The paper is in progress. Moreover, I contribute to the SageMath package for working with \\(\\mathsf{GT}\\)-shadows. I learned many precautions in academic writing, like how to write a proper introduction and how to organize sections in a flow. I also practiced my SageMath programming skills (especially libgap), and OOP method.\nI am admitted to the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship at Université de Sherbrooke under the mentorship of Prof. Maxence Mayrand. I constructed new GKP codes from the Abelian varieties on the cyclotomic field and computed the decomposition of the corresponding Clifford gate as H-gate, S-gate, and CNOT-gate. Meanwhile, I developed SageMath scripts for working with GKP codes constructed from the cyclotomic field. We use the book Complex Abelian Varieties by Herbert Lange. This research experience enhanced my programming skills and the ability to apply mathematics to solve concrete problems."

    "text": "Overcoming Obstacles\nBy determination and the help of professors and friends, I have overcome various obstacles encountered on my mathematical path. The most harmful (bureaucratic) obstacle was a policy that limited a particular portion of students’ options to either pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at their current institution or change their academic focus (from pure mathematics to applied mathematics). I overcame this obstacle by taking the required courses in both pure mathematics and applied mathematics and devoting double efforts to coursework. Another obstacle was that as an exchange undergraduate student at Temple University, I was not allowed to enroll in graduate mathematics courses. Thanks to Prof. David Futer, the Graduate Director, I was granted permission to enroll in graduate mathematics courses after reaching out."

    "text": "RESEARCH EXPERIENCE\n\nPolymath Jr.\nThis is a group project. Our group gives algebraic and complex analytic approaches to computing an affine model for \\(K_9\\) dessin, and I draw a visualization of \\(K_9\\) dessin through the morphism \\(\\pi_1(P_8/\\sim) \\to \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_8]/(1+\\sqrt{-2})\\). For my contribution, I work out the algebraic approaches and draw the visualization. I also gave the final presentation of the group work, wrote the algebraic approaches part of the paper (the paper is still in progress), and made the poster that was submitted to JMM 2025. If there is no visa issue, I will go to JMM 2025 and give a talk about that.\n\n\nIndependent Study with Professor Vasily Dolgushev\n\n\n\nBICMR AI4MATH\nI collaborate with four students to formalize in lean4 that Algebraic integer of \\(\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{-3}]\\) is PID. I learn a a lot of knowledge about functional programming and constructing a proof assistant. I lean some basic dependent type theory. Above all, I gain more ability of collaboration and of learning new things quickly."
