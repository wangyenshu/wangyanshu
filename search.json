For my contribution, I work out the algebraic approaches and draw the visualization. I also gave the final presentation of the group work, wrote the algebraic approaches part of the paper (the paper is still in progress), and made the poster that was submitted to JMM 2025. If there is no visa issue, I will go to JMM 2025 and give a talk about that."
