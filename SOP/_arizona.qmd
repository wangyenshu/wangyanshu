I am applying University of Arizona because it has a large mathematics department and a vibrant number theory research group. Also, University of Arizona hosts the well-known Arizona Winter School every year. That is why I left my contact information on University of Arizona's table at the JMM 2025 Grad Fair and was looking forward to join this vibrant community.
