I think Concordia University is a great place to study number theory. Concordia University is a member of Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques, so students can enroll courses in other member Universities. Moreover, Concordia University is a member of ALGANT program. Also, Montreal has a vibrant number theory group. These are main reasons why I apply to Concordia University.
