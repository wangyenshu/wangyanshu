Professor Maxence Mayrand highly recommended me to apply for McGill University. I am interested in the number theory research group, especially Professor Eyal Goren. That is because I am interested in complex multiplication and have experience with complex multiplication in my mitacs research in universit√© de sherbrooke. Moreover, Montreal is a beautiful city with a vibrant number theory group.
