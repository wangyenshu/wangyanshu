This semester I am self-learning etale cohomology and Artin-Verdier duality using Mazur's notes, Thomas Zink's appendix and Roger W. Carter's appendix. This topic exposed me a lot of advanced mathematics, including spectral sequence, derived functor, Grothendieck topology. Probably, my bachelor thesis will be about this topic. Briefly speaking, Artin-Verdier duality states that the ring of integers in a number field of finite degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ behaves like a $3$-manifold.

Under the supervision of Professor Vasily Dolgushev, I conducted the research that introduced a more streamlined version of the groupoid $\mathsf{GTSh}$ of $\mathsf{GT}$-shadows and contributed to the SageMath package for working with $\mathsf{GT}$-shadows. The groupoid $\mathsf{GTSh}$ is a ‘computable’ approximation to the gentle version of the Grothendieck–Teichmüller group $\widehat{\mathsf{GT}}_{gen}$. The set of objects of $\mathsf{GTSh}$ is the poset $\mathsf{NFI}^{\mathrm{B}_3}(\mathrm{F}_2)$ of $\mathrm{B}_3$-invariant finite index normal subgroups of the free 
group $\mathrm{F}_2$ on two generators. This object is worth studying because it is very ‘likely’ that in most cases, the morphism of $\mathsf{GTSh}$ lifts to the absolute Galois group $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$. And it is already known that for a specific subposet $\mathsf{Dih}_2$ of dihedral posets, if $K$ is an element of $\mathsf{Dih}_2$, every morphism of the connected componenet of $K$ in $\mathsf{GTSh}$ lifts to an element of $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$.

Mentored by Professor Maxence Mayrand, I participated in a research internship that constructed new GKP code from the Abelian varieties on the cyclotomic field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$. The construction $(K \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R})/\mathcal{O}_K$ is an abelian variety of CM-type. We defined a skew-symmetric form $E$ and extended it to a hermitian inner product $H$ on $(K \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R})/\mathcal{O}_K$. Under certain restrictions, this defines a GKP code. There is a homomorphism from $\mathrm{Aut}(X,L)$ to $\{\text{unitary operators on }H^0(X,L\otimes L)\}$, the gates. It is already known that this construction produces Clifford gates. I computed the decomposition of these Clifford gates as the Hadamard gate, S-gate and CNOT-gate. An interesting phenomenon is that the expression of the gate produced by the case $n=5$ contains CNOT-gate.

Under the supervision of Professor Lisa Berger, Ajmain Yamin and Connor Stewart, I participated in an online collaborative research to obtain equations for $K_9$ dessin, that is the bipartification dessin of the complete regular map from $K_9$ graph. We proved that the Riemann surface of the $K_9$ dessin is a degree $9$ cover of the Bolza surface $y^2=x(x^4-1)$ with covering group $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2$. We used the fact that any unramified abelian cover of a Riemann surface $S$ is obtained from pulling back S along an unramified abelian cover of the Jacobian $\mathrm{Jac}(S)$ of $S$. So, we computed the equation for the Abel-Jacobi map of the Bolza surface $S_B$ and constructed a degree $9$ cover of the Jacobian $\mathrm{Jac}(S_B)$ and obtained the equation. 

These research experiences let me explore a wide range of mathematics and significantly improve my self-learning, writing, programming and speaking skills. It is these research experiences that boost my determination to seek admission to a graduate program and do mathematical research.
