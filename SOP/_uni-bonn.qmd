I am applying to University of Bonn for several reasons. First, University of Bonn has a large and prestigious mathematics department, with many well-known research institutes. So students can have access to wide ranges of mathematical courses and have chances to talk to many first class researchers. Also, University of Bonn has the best algebra and number theory master program in Germany. Whatsmore, I like the Bonn city because of its widespread reputations as a city of the arts.
