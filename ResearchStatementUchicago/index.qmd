## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Polymath Jr.

This is a group project. Our group gives algebraic and complex analytic approaches to computing an affine model for $K_9$ dessin, and I draw a visualization of $K_9$ dessin through the morphism $\pi_1(P_8/\sim) \mapsto \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_8]/(1+\sqrt{-2})$. For my contribution, I work out the algebraic approaches and draw the visualization. I also gave the final presentation of the group work, wrote the algebraic approaches part of the paper (the paper is still in progress), and made the poster that was submitted to JMM 2025. If there is no visa issue, I will go to JMM 2025 and give a talk about that.

## OTHER EXPERIENCE

#### BICMR AI4MATH

I collaborate with four students to formalize in lean4 that Algebraic integer of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{-3}]$ is PID. I learn a a lot of knowledge about functional programming and constructing a proof assistant. I lean some basic dependent type theory. Above all, I gain more ability of collaboration and of learning new things quickly.

## STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

need to change

I am interested in number theory. I have done the Polymath Jr. REU with the topic of Dessin d'enfant (arithmetic approach). I have finished relevant courses including Abstract Algebra, Galois Theory, Number Theory, and Commutative Algebra. Currently, I am self-learning scheme theory to prepare to learn arithmetic geometry and at the same time, taking the Analytic Number Theory course. I have experience of writing papers and am fluent with latex. My programming skills also includes C++, python, lean4, html & css & javascript.
